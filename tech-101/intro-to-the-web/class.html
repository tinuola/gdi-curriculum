						Normally you can't do much about inconveniences, but in the 60s, the US was in the middle of the Cold War. It had a lot of money set aside for academics' productivity.

					<aside class="notes">
						At first, this was just for things like email and downloading files; you couldn't surf the web.
						But in 1989, an English computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee working at a Swiss organization called CERN wrote a proposal for a language called HTML. Basically everything you've ever seen in your web browser is an HTML fil, but they started off simpler. Tim Berners-Lee invented the web browser to render HTML.

					<p style="font-size: 20px;">Screenshot from July 2021</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Files written in HTML would look like an academic journal article, with text and lists and tables, but the new thing about HTML is that you could click "hyperlinks" to be brought to other HTML files. This made it easier to reference otehr academics' work and to add footnotes.
						HTML was never meant to be used for interactivity, the way we expect our websites to behave now. But it was a part of the start of the world wide web, a collection of websites that anyone in the world with access to the Internet could access just by entering a URL. This proposal went over well!

					<aside class="notes">
						By 1995, multiple web browsers existed, and they were fighting each other for market share. One of these was called Netscape. Netscape asked a software engineer named Brendan Eich to create something that none of the other web browsers had: A second language, which would allow a website to contain interactivity - calculators,  ticking clocks, playing games. They wanted a language that would be easy for experienced programmers to learn, hard for inexperienced programmers to mess up, and powerful, and they all wanted it in 2 weeks!
						Somehow he pulled it off and created a language called JavaScript, but because of these constraints, it has a lot of quirks we still live with today. Nonetheless, it caught on big time.

					<aside class="notes">
						In 1996, as the web became more mainstream and less confined to academic spaces, a language called CSS was implemented to help make web pages more friendly to professional publication, like business and news websites.

					<aside class="notes">
						In 2012, as more and more people started accessing the web via small-screened devices like smart phones, we got a new feature in CSS called "media queries", which let you change how a web page looks on different screen sizes. This was part of a movement called "responsive design", which is about making the web easier to use on small screens as well as large screens, because small screens are how much of the world navigates the web today.

					<h2>Web pages</h2>
					<p>You don’t have to be on the web to use a web browser.</p>
					<p>Web browsers read HTML, JavaScript and CSS to render web pages.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Web pages</h2>
					<img src="assets/imgs/html-hello-world-example.png" style="height: 30vh;"> 
					<img src="assets/imgs/html-hello-world-rendered.png" style="height: 30vh;">

					<aside class="notes">
						HTML is a very simple language. It doesn't do much, just helps you lay out a page. So it's easy to get started. You can literally write these 5 lines in a text file and open it in your browser, and you've written HTML. This isn't much different from how web pages looked abck in the early 90s.
					</aside>

					<h2>Web pages</h2>
					<img src="assets/imgs/html-js-hello-world-example.png" style="width: 50%;"> 
					<img src="assets/imgs/html-js-hello-world-rendered.png" style="height: 30vh;">

					<aside class="notes">
						If you want to add interactivity, you can use JavaScript. This simple example shows today's date, but you can get much more complicated - any time you click or tap on a button in a web page and something changes, that's JavaScript code making it happen. Again, you can type these few lines into a text file and open it in your web browser, and you'll see exactly what you're seeing now - except with whatever the current date is.

						But do you notice how the text here is really small, and it's in the kind of font you would see in an essay you wrote in school?

					<aside class="notes">
						If you want your text bigger and easier to read, and you want to use more modern fonts, you can use CSS. CSS was simple at fist, just changing the font color and size and rearranging layouts. But you can do some very sophisticated things with CSS now.

					<p>Give it to the post office, which routes it through many post offices to get to its destination.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Hand it off to the post office, which will route it through potentially multiple post offices to get it to your friend.
						This is a map of post offices in New Orleans, for example. (Gesture to show some possible routes the letter could take.)
						You don't need it to go straight to them; it could take a circuitous route and it will still get there because each post office can make a good decision about how to forward it in the right direction.
						You also don't have to tell them how to get the letter to your friend's house. The post office network handles that for you.

						Your friend will receive it and send their news back to you. It might go through a completely different route.

					<p>Design</p>
					<ul style="text-align: left;">
						<li>Aesthetics and layout</li>
						<li>User experience</li>
						<li>Design a specific website, or design templates that can be reused</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						On a team, designers are some of the most important people. The difference between a good designer and a bad designer is the difference between your product being understandable and usable, vs. incoherent, confusing, and sketchy.

						Aesthetics: How should it look, on large screens and small screens? What graphics should be used?

						UX: How should forms behave as the user interacts with them? What should the flow be when uploading a file? What should happen when an error occurs?

						These are closely intertwined. Some designers do both, while others specialize, and there are lots of other ways to specialize too.

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						A front-end developer writes the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that your web browser will run to show you the web page.

						On a team, if you're lucky, this means implementing the designers' designs.

						Entails:
						filling in gaps where the designs are underspecified,
						making sure everything runs smoothly and without errors,
						ensuring the code is both fast and legible to other programmers,
						and using code to communicate with servers you don't have control over
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Careers</h2>
					<p>Back-end web development</p>
					<ul style="text-align: left;">
						<li>Write code in any language that runs on the host server</li>
						<li>Write fast and secure code to process requests from anyone, including hackers</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						A back-end developer writes the code that runs on the server.

						You can use any language that the server can run. PHP was popular for a long time. Many startups today use popular languages like python, JavaScript, and ruby. Bigger organizations might choose to use languages like Java or C#.

						Entails:
						securely handling requests from anyone on the internet, including hackers
						writing responses in a way that the front-end developers can actually use
						sometimes architecture and language decisions

						Full-stack developers do both front-end and back-end development.
						Some people like to do full-stack plus design, which is hard, but makes you a very appealing freelancer to small startups short on money and HR.

						Many startups can't afford a QA person, but they make a huge difference when they come on board! Just about any web development company that can afford one has a QA team, and a lot of people do QA as a first role in tech.

						Manually click through websites to ensure everythign matches the designs and feels smooth and leigble. A good manual QA tester will find things a developer never thought to look at.

						Software engineering to build automated testers. These programs can be as simple as a smoke test, or simulate clicking through the website, making sure that necessary flows like logging in and logging out are still functioning.
