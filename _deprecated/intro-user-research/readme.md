## Course description

User research is one of a number of disciplines that fall within the field of user experience. Before designing a product, software, or website, it is critical to know who will be using it and what their overarching goals are. User research aims to answer these questions in an effort to provide you and your team with in-depth knowledge about what your users are trying to accomplish and how your product could help them. The goal for conducting this type of research before designing your product, is to reduce the risk of creating something your users don’t need or want.

During this course we’ll clarify what user research is and its importance in the user experience process. You’ll get a foundation on how to create and conduct your own study, analyze your findings, and implement those findings into a deliverable. This class is low-tech, but highly collaborative. Be prepared to engage with your fellow classmates and leave with the confidence to start your own research project.
